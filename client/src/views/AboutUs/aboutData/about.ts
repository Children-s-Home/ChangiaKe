  "Changia was formed in 2023 in response to the founders' struggle to find volunteering opportunities during their university's Community-based Learning period. Realizing the difficulty of finding suitable establishments, they decided to create a platform to facilitate community engagement. Their primary goals included enlisting and verifying children's homes in Nairobi, showcasing their needs to potential donors, and making the process of giving back easier for everyone. With the support of their friends, they formed a dedicated team and developed a comprehensive product aimed at creating a meaningful impact. They welcome questions, ideas, feedback, or simply a friendly greeting from users of their platform.";
